# Smart Transportation System

## üö¶ Overview

- This project is a Smart Transportation System designed to monitor and evaluate real-time traffic congestion in urban areas using traffic surveillance cameras. The system processes video streams, applies deep learning models for vehicle detection and tracking and outputs key traffic metrics such as avarage vehicle count and avarage speed. These metrics are served via a local API and continuously streamed to a frontend interface.

- Additionally, the system aims to integrate a chatbot-based query interface that allows drivers or users to request traffic information about specific routes. The chatbot leverages language models and natural language processing to provide concise and useful responses, making the system both interactive and driver-friendly.

## üéØ Objectives

- Apply object detection and object tracking (e.g., YOLO with Bytetrack algorithm) to extract vehicle parameters such as avarage vehicle count and avarage speed.
- Predict traffic congestion levels based on visual data.
- Provide a simple API for querying traffic insights.
- Stream results to a frontend client for visualization.
- Support natural language queries about current traffic status through an integrated chatbot interface.


## üß™ How to Run
## Please download `video road` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gkac5U5jEs174p7V7VC3rCmgvO_cVwxH?usp=drive_link) and put it into `BACKEND` folder
### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Required libraries from `requirements_cpu.txt` or `requirements_gpu.txt`
- Web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
- NODEJS > 18

### üíæ Installation for FRONTEND

#### install libraries:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### üíæ Installation for BACKEND

#### Firstly:
```bash
cd BACKEND
```

#### Secondly:

##### For running on CPU 

```bash
pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
```

##### For running on GPU

```bash
pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
```

#### Create `.env` file (required for Gemini API)

In the `BACKEND` directory, create a file named `.env` and add your Google API key:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### üöÄ Launch the System

#### Run frontend:
Back to root
```bash
cd ..
```

```bash
npm start
```

#### Run backend:

```bash
cd BACKEND
```

```bash
uvicorn fast_api:app --reload
```

- API will run at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`


## üß† Technologies Used

### Backend

- Python
- OpenCV, YOLO (custom-trained)
- Object Tracking (Bytetrack)
- FastAPI
- Multithreading (for processing multiple video streams)
- Langchain Platform (for building the LLM-driven chatbot)

### Frontend

- ReactJS 

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Design

### A. Video Tracking and Traffic Analysis

- Each video stream is assigned to a dedicated processing thread (1 video = 1 worker).
- YOLO + Bytetrack are used to detect and track vehicles.
- Extracted metrics: avarage vehicle count, average speed (for cars & motorbikes).
- Processed results are stored in a shared variable with proper thread synchronization.

### B. API Layer

- Built with FastAPI.
- Provides 3 main endpoints:

#### 1. `/frames` (GET)

Returns the latest frame image for each road:

```json
{
  "road_name": {
    "frame": "<base64-encoded image>"
  }
}
```

#### 2. `/veheicles` (GET)

Returns vehicle information for each road:

```json
{
  "road_name": {
    "count_car": <average number of cars>,
    "count_motor": <average number of motorbikes>,
    "speed_car": <average speed of cars>,
    "speed_motor": <average speed of motorbikes>
  }
}
```

#### 3. `/chat` (POST)

Receives a prompt from the frontend and returns a chatbot response:

```json
{
  "message": "your massage"
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "response": "AI response"
}
```

### C. Client Visualization

- The web frontend continuously fetches `/frames` (every 200ms) and `/veheicles` (every 1s).
- Data is merged and displayed visually: camera images, average vehicle counts & average speeds for each road.

### D. Chatbot Query Interface

- Uses Gemini API and Langchain Platform.
- Users can ask: "What is the traffic like on Nguyen Trai street?"
- The chatbot responds based on the latest traffic data.
